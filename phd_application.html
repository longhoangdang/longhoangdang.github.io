					<h4>2024-2025 Intake</h4>
					I am currently seeking PTIT undergraduate students (2nd, 3rd, and 4th year) for research opportunities. Selected students will have the chance to collaborate with experts in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML&AI) and potentially submit their work to prestigious conferences and journals in these fields.
Students interested in working with me on ML&AI projects under my supervision are encouraged to send their applications via email.
				</div>
				
				<div class="sect-lv4">
					<h4>Research Topics</h4>
					
					<p>
						Below, I list some of my broad research topics which I expect prospective students 
						will work on under my supervision. If you are interested in these topics or 
						have any other research proposals, don't hesitate to contact me and we 
						can discuss further &#128516;. 
					</p>
					
					<ul class="ul-topics">
						<li><span class="topic-title">Generative Models</span></li>
						
						<li><span class="topic-title">Vision and Language Reasoning</span></li>
						
						<li><span class="topic-title">Large Vision-Language Models</span></li>
						
						<li><span class="topic-title">Domain Generalization</span></li>		
					</ul>
					
					<!--
					<p>
						Although not compulsory, students are encouraged to have good background knowledge about
